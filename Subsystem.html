<h4 class="subsystemsubheadings">Aerodynamics:</h4>
<p class="SubsystemContent">The Aerodynamics Subsystem deals with the conceptualization, design, and simulation of aircrafts. The core engineering aspects are aerodynamics, flight mechanics and design. The use of CAD, simulation/analysis software such as ANSYS, CATIA and a variety of other applications is implemented.</p>

<h4 class="subsystemsubheadings">Avionics and Drone Research:</h4>
<p class="SubsystemContent">Avionics and Drone Research subsystem involves work on various aspects of research related to RC electronics, innovations in the field of autonomous flight, and employing drones for social causes. Some of the projects of this subsystem include building swarm of drones, a photography drone and a tricopter.</p>

<h4 class="subsystemsubheadings">Materials and Analysis (M&A):</h4>
<p class="SubsystemContent">This division was established last year as the research and development wing of AeroMIT, primarily in the fields of advanced materials. Various industry level methods such as 4 axis CNC Hot Wire Cutter, Laser Cutters, Vacuum Bagging among other processes are incorporated to facilitate the development of lightweight and strong Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. This division will continue to explore the immense possibilities and solutions offered by the use of Polymer Matrix Composites in aero-modelling.</p>

<h4 class="subsystemsubheadings">Structures:</h4>
<p class="SubsystemContent">The structures subsystem is responsible for building and testing the radio controlled aircraft. It analyses the feasibility of the aircraft design developed by the aerodynamics subsystem and makes structural design changes if needed. It includes core RC aero-modelling where scale models are built. 
Analysis of the stresses on aircraft, selection of suitable materials, fabrication and testing of
builds, experimenting with new ideas are few of the many things this subsystem
does.</p>

<h4 class="subsystemsubheadings">Management:</h4>
<p class="SubsystemContent">The Management Subsystem is responsible for procurement of sponsors, handling of finances and managing resources for the team. Management personnel will be responsible for handling all HR aspects of the team as well and establish smooth working processes for all departments.
